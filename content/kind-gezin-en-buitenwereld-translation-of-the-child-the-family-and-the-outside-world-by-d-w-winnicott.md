Since 2022, Kasper's activities as an artist-retiree have included translating the book [*The Child, the Family and the Outside World* by D.W. Winnicott](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/13592/the-child-the-family-and-the-outside-world-by-dw-winnicott/9780241455685) to Dutch, as a way to share his enthusiasm for this classic of the psychology of the early childhood with the global Dutch-speaking community.

In October 2025, this translation was published as *Kind, gezin en buitenwereld* by [Borgerhoff & Lamberigts from Ghent](https://www.borgerhoff-lamberigts.be/shop/boeken/kind-gezin-en-buitenwereld).
